I need to remove the python backend call from the frontend and instead integrate a PHP food analysis API endpoint into this HTML frontend. The endpoint is at https://wegalabs.com/cal.php and analyzes food images to provide nutritional information.

ENDPOINT INFORMATION:

- URL: https://wegalabs.com/cal.php

- Method: POST

- Headers: 

  - Content-Type: application/json

- Request Body: 

  { "image": "[base64-encoded image data]" }

ENDPOINT RESPONSE FORMAT:

{

  "food_name": "Name of the food",

  "calories": 123,

  "protein": 10, 

  "carbs": 20,

  "fat": 5,

  "serving_size": "Standard serving size",

  "confidence": 0.95

}

Please edit the HTML and JavaScript frontend code such that:

1. Allows users to upload or take a photo of food

2. Displays a preview of the selected image

3. Has a button to analyze the image

4. Shows a loading state during analysis

5. Displays the nutritional information in a visually appealing way

6. Handles errors gracefully
